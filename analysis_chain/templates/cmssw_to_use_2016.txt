for lhe and gen step:
SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc480

and CMSSW release:
CMSSW_7_1_43_patch1

note for this case you need to run the .lhe files first diurectly using the gridpack
then modify lhe_2016.py to list the .lhe files as inputs

Note you also need to be using the correct SCRAM_ARCH before you submit the jobs to the grid
The issue is that this CMSSW release does not exist for SLC7 so you can actually test the jobs locally before submitting them but if you use the correct SCRAM_ARCH and cmsenv inside the CMSSW release 
the job should get run on a node with SLC6
you can submit a small job first to check it works since you can't test it locally


For the next steps we can use SLC7 so we can test locally again


for premix and aod steps
SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc530

and CMSSW release:
CMSSW_8_0_31


for miniaod step:
SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc630

and CMSSW release:
CMSSW_9_4_9
