# GenSubmissions

First copy all of the tarball files into this working directory.

To submit GEN-SIM crab jobs for all tarball files in your working directory run a command like:

```bash
python run_gridpacks.py --run_all --gen
```

To run future steps you can change --gen with either --premix, --aod or --miniaod.
